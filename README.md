The following are the major use cases associated with this 
project:
1. Supplier Side:
Our project's supplier is our client, Annapurna 
Restaurant. The project gives the restaurant a platform 
to advertise its services and goods. This ensures a 
diverse audience. It also allows for efficiency gains 
because the platform fee is significantly lower than 
that charged by the mediators. The loyalty plan 
ensures that the restaurant has a consistent income 
stream. The review system would give Annapurna 
valuable feedback, allowing them to enhance their 
menu items.
2. Customer Side:
Because of the wide variety of items on the platform, 
the consumer's options grow exponentially. It enables 
them to compare and obtain the best meals based on 
their preferences. The numerous options also foster a 
healthy competitive environment, which helps our 
client and their expansion of restaurants throughout 
the city.
