1. Supplier Side:
Our project's supplier is our client, Annapurna 
Restaurant. The project gives the restaurant a platform 
to advertise its services and goods. This ensures a 
diverse audience. It also allows for efficiency gains 
because the platform fee is significantly lower than 
that charged by the mediators. The loyalty plan 
ensures that the restaurant has a consistent income 
stream. The review system would give Annapurna 
valuable feedback, allowing them to enhance their 
menu items.
2. Customer Side:
Because of the wide variety of items on the platform, 
the consumer's options grow exponentially. It enables 
them to compare and obtain the best meals based on 
their preferences. The numerous options also foster a 
healthy competitive environment, which helps our 
client and their expansion of restaurants throughout 
the city.

There are numerous subsections in this document of software 
requirements specifications. The purpose, scope, and organization of 
the document are all explained in the first section. The definition of 
project-specific terms, acronyms, and abbreviations utilized in the 
document is also covered in the first section.
The functionalities of the software are described in non-technical 
terms in the second section of the document. It serves as a preface to 
the section on technical requirements in the third part of the 
document and describes the informal requirements.
All of the specifications outlined for this system are enumerated in 
the third section. It explains the software's intricate functionality in 
technical terms and is primarily aimed at developers.

An overview of the topic AMOS is given in the next section. A thorough 
review of the system, user, hardware, software, and transceiver, memory 
considerations, operational modes, and site adaptation requirements has 
worked to put the product into perspective. Beyond the identified system 
constraints and assumptions, the discussion includes the final features of 
the system. The section has been finished with a breakdown of the 
requirements.

A full AMOS system is software described in this SRS. The model 
utilizes various pieces of hardware and software and additionally 
connects to external systems. Thus, even though the software handles 
the majority of the system's functionality, it also physically interacts 
with people and relies on several external interfaces for persistence 
and unhandled tasks.
System Interfaces
To handle customer billing quickly and easily, AMOS interfaces with 
an existing payment system, such as a cash register and softwareaccessible credit system. The payment system must be functional to 
inform the AMOS system whether the payment was successful or 
unsuccessful.
Surface computer UI
Customers of restaurants interact with the Surface Computer UI. 
Users of AMOS can move items such as food items, dietary needs, 
tips, and menus around on their PC. These objects can be 
transferred into objects, like meals and payments, to carry out a 
range of tasks. In regards to this paradigm for object 
manipulation, a constrained system menu is required. Using a 
simple touch gesture, a double-tap on the touch surface, users 
will call up their restaurant menu, which is combined with a 
scheme menu, and will dismiss it with similar gesture or by 
tapping a close button GUI element.
